- What's the glube supposed to do when the player is far from it?
- What's the glube supposed to do when the player comes near to them?
- How does the player interact with the glube?

1. Bounce around mostly in place but progressing in one direction. Randomized is fine
Using physics ideally

2. If it’s been longer than cooldown time in seconds since the last time (if ever) a player entered a “proximity collider” then it should Jump randomly

3. Player interacts with glube by getting within the players grab radius collider and pressing the one button
(Until/if we implement fighting there’s only one button to pick up and throw)
When a player picks up a glube, we should destroy that glube and then activate the shoulder-mounted one attached to the player
And because its scope; an instantaneous change in location is fine. We can mask it with a puff of smoke/particles
When the shoulder-mounted glube is within deposit distance of the players trash can, glube should jump from the players shoulder into that players trashcan. This should be a third and completely separate blueprint 

4. Glubes spawn from one of the three pipes in the wall. Each pipe will be an identical blueprint but in a different world position and rotation
